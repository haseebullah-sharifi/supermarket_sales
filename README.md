# Supermarket Sales Analysis with SQL and Google Sheets

## Project Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of supermarket sales data using SQL and Google Sheets. The objective was to clean and prepare the data, perform analysis, and visualize the results through an interactive dashboard.

## Project Workflow

#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation in SQL
* **Data Source:** The raw data was initially loaded into MySQL.
* **Cleaning Process:** Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting any inconsistencies. Specific columns were selected for the analysis, and unnecessary columns were discarded.
* **Dataset Creation:** The cleaned and refined dataset was saved as `supermarket_sales1`.

#### 2. Data Import and Manipulation in Google Sheets
* **Importing Data:** The `supermarket_sales1` dataset was imported into Google Sheets.
* **Data Manipulation:** Further manipulation was carried out in Google Sheets, including data transformations and calculations to prepare for the analysis phase.

#### 3. Data Analysis with Pivot Tables
* **Pivot Tables:** Various pivot tables were created to summarize and analyze the data. These pivot tables provided insights into key metrics such as total sales, average sales, sales by category, and sales by region.
* **Chart Creation:** For each pivot table, corresponding charts were created to visually represent the data and make it easier to understand trends and patterns.

#### 4. Dashboard Creation
* **Dashboard Design:** An interactive dashboard was designed in Google Sheets, combining all the charts and key metrics from the pivot tables. The dashboard allows for dynamic data exploration and provides a clear overview of the supermarket sales performance.

## Key Features
* **Data Cleaning with SQL:** Ensured data integrity and relevance by cleaning the dataset in SQL.
* **Comprehensive Analysis:** Utilized pivot tables to perform in-depth analysis of various sales metrics.
* **Interactive Visualization:** Developed an interactive dashboard in Google Sheets for easy data visualization and interpretation.

## Files in Repository
* **`supermarket_sales.csv`:** Original dataset downloaded from Kaggle.
* **`Data Cleaning and Extraction with SQL.sql`:** SQL script used for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
* **`supermarket_sales1.xlsx`:** Google Sheets file containing data manipulation, pivot tables, charts, and the final dashboard.
* **`README.md`:** This readme file providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use
* **SQL Script:** Run the `Data Cleaning and Extraction with SQL.sql` script to clean and prepare the raw data in a SQL database.
* **Import Data:** Import the `supermarket_sales1.xlsx` file into Google Sheets.
* **Analyze Data:** Use the provided Google Sheets file to explore the data through pivot tables and charts.
* **View Dashboard:** Navigate to the dashboard sheet within the Google Sheets file to view the interactive visualizations.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for data cleaning and Google Sheets for data analysis and visualization. The combination of these tools provides a robust framework for analyzing and presenting supermarket sales data, offering valuable insights into sales performance and trends.
